## I. Formal Proofs

Use the rules of inference from class (reprinted below) to construct formal, numbered proofs of the following:

### 1. 

Assuming _p -> q_ and _p -> r_, prove _p -> (q AND r)_

```
1. p -> q     		Given
2. p -> r     		Given
3. p 		  		Assumption
4. q 		  		Assumption
5. r 		  		2, 3, Modus Ponens
6. q AND r 	  		4, 5, Conjunction
7. p -> (q AND r) 	3, 6, Modus Ponens 
```

### 2.

Assuming _p -> (q OR r)_ and _p -> (q OR NOT r)_, prove _p -> q_

```
1. p -> (q OR r)          		Given
2. p -> (q OR NOT r)      		Given
3. p 					  		Assumption
4. (q OR r)				  		1, 3, Modus Ponens
5. (q OR NOT r)			  		2, 3, Modus Ponens
6. (q OR r) AND (q OR NOT r)	4, 5, Conjunction
Therefore, p -> (q OR r) AND (q OR NOT r)
```

## II. Truth tables

Use a truth table to show the equivalence of the assumptions and conclusion from problem 1, above:  Assuming _p -> q_ and _p -> r_, prove _p -> (q AND r)_

[Style note:  what is the canonical order of the rows in a truth table for three propositions?]

| p | q | r | p -> q | p -> r | q^r | p -> q^r |
|---|---|---|--------|--------|-----|----------|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |    1   |    1   |  0  |    1     |   
| 0 | 0 | 1 |    1   |    0   |  0  |    1     |    
| 0 | 1 | 0 |    0   |    1   |  0  |    1     |      
| 0 | 1 | 1 |    0   |    0   |  1  |    0     |     
| 1 | 0 | 0 |    0   |    0   |  0  |    0     |      
| 1 | 0 | 1 |    0   |    1   |  0  |    0     |    
| 1 | 1 | 0 |    1   |    0   |  0  |    0     |     
| 1 | 1 | 1 |    1   |    1   |  1  |    1     |

## III. Tautology, satisfiable, contradiction

Which of the following are tautologies?  Satisfiable?  Unsatisfiable (contradictions)?

### 1. _(p AND q AND r) -> (p OR q)_

| p | q | r | p AND q AND r | p OR q |
|---|---|---|---------------|--------|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |       0       |    0   |   
| 0 | 0 | 1 |       0       |	 0   |   
| 0 | 1 | 0 |       0 		|	 1	 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |       0		|	 1	 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |       0		|	 1	 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |       0		|	 1	 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |       0		|	 1	 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |       1		|	 1	 |

Tautology - when the premise (p AND q AND r) is true, the conclusion (p OR q) is always true.

### 2. _((p -> q) AND (q -> r)) -> (p -> r)_

| p | q | r | p -> q | q -> r | (p -> q) AND (p -> r) | p -> r |
|---|---|---|--------|--------|-----------------------|--------|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |    1   |    1   |            1          |    1   |
| 0 | 0 | 1 |    1   |    0   |            0          |    0   |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |    0   |    1   |            0          |    1   |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |    0   |    0   |            1		  |    0   |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |    0   |	  0	  |			   1		  |    0   |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |    0   |	  1	  |			   0		  |	   1   |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |    1   |	  0	  |			   0		  |    0   |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |    1	 |	  1	  |			   1		  |    1   |

Satisfiable.

### 3. _(p -> q) -> p_

| p | q | p -> q |
|---|---|--------|
| 0 | 0 |   1    |
| 0 | 1 |   0    |
| 1 | 0 |   0    |
| 1 | 1 |   1    |

Satisfiable. 


### 4. _(p OR q OR r) AND ((NOT p) OR (NOT q) OR (NOT r)) AND (p OR (NOT q)) AND (q OR (NOT r)) OR (r OR (not p))_ 

(1): (p OR q OR r)
(2): ((NOT p) OR (NOT q) or (NOT r))
(3): (p OR (NOT q))
(4): (q OR (NOT r))
(5): (r OR (NOT p))

| p | q | r | (1) | (2) | (3) | (4) | (5) |
|---|---|---|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |  0  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |
| 0 | 0 | 1 |  1  |  1  |  1  |  0  |  1  |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |  1  |  1  |  0  |  1  |  1  |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |  1  |  1  |  0  |  1	|  1  |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |  1  |	 1	|  1  |  1	|  0  |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |  1  |	 1	|  1  |  0	|  1  |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |  1  |	 1	|  1  |  1	|  0  |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |  1  |	 0	|  1  |  1	|  1  |

Contradiction. There is no combination of p, q, and r values that result in (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) all being true.

### 5. [** challenge/optional] _(p <=> (q OR r)) -> ((NOT q) -> (p AND r))_


## IV. CNF

Transform the following formula into conjunctive normal form.  Show your steps.

_p OR (q AND ~(r AND (s -> t)))_

```
p OR (q AND ~(r AND (~s OR t)))
p OR (q AND (~r OR ~(~s OR t)))		De Morgan's
p OR (q AND (~r OR (s AND ~t)))		De Morgan's
p OR (q AND ((~r OR s) AND (~r OR ~t)))
(p OR q) AND (p OR ((~r OR s) AND (~r OR ~t)))
(p OR q) AND ((p OR ~r OR s) AND (p OR ~r OR ~t))
```

## V. Short certificate

Demonstrate that the formula in problem IV is satisfiable.  Explain whether you used a  "short certificate" or exhaustive enumeration to make this determination.

If p is true, the formula is satisfiable (this is a short certificate).  This formula is a series of AND'ed OR statements that each include p.
