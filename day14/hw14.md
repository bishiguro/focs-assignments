I. Math

In the following problems, we will look at how rapidly different functions grow.  We are interested in figuring out when two functions grow at the same rate.  Our definition of “the same” is:  f(n) grows no faster than g(n) if there is some minimum value for the argument (we’ll call it n0) after which f(n) is no larger than a constant multiple of g(n) -- call it k*g(n).  For example, if f(n) is 367n+1098 and g(n) is 2n, n0 could be 40 and k could be 200:  367n+1098 <= 200*2n for n>40.

For each of the following pairs of functions, identify a multiplier and a minimum value of n for which the first is no larger than the specified multiple of the second.  If you cannot -- if there are no such values -- explain why not.


  A. 367n+1098 and 2n [n0 = 40; k=200]
  B. n^2 + 2n + 6 and 6n^2 - 25
  C. n^3 + n^2 - 2n     and     6n^2 - 25
  D. 869,438    and    923
  E. 2^n    and    3^n
  F. 3^n    and    2^n
  G. log_2 n     and    log_10 n    [NB:  these are intended to be log-base-2 of n and log-base-10 of n]
  H. log_10 n^2    and     log_2 n


II. Linear data structures

For the following problem, assume that it costs 1 unit to access a structure -- an item in an array, a field in a record you are holding, the first element in a linked list -- whether reading or writing that element.  [Accessing the second element in a linked list costs 2 units if you have a pointer to the list:  1 unit to access the first element/read its “next” pointer, and another unit to access the second element.]

Assume that you have n elements stored in an array and the same n elements stored in a linked list; you have no other references to these data structures.  You may assume that n > 10.  How much does it cost to perform each of the following actions?

  A. Read the value of the first element in the array?  In the list?
  ``` 
  Array: 1 unit 
  List: 1 unit
  ```

  B. Read the value of the seventh element in the array?  In the list?

  ``` 
  Array: 1 unit 
  List: 7 units
  ```

  C. Add an element to the array?  [Where is the cheapest place to add it?]  To the list?  [Where is the cheapest place to add it?]

  ``` 
  Array: n+1 units
    After the last element - no existing elements have to be shifted, but if you don't know the length of the array, you need to traverse all elements to find the last one
  List: 1 unit
    Before the first element - by having the new element point to it
  ```

  D. Delete the fifth element from the array?  From the list?
  ``` 
  Array: 1 + 2(n-5)
    Delete the fifth element, then access each of the later elements and write their values to the preceding index
  List: 5
    Access elements 1-4 and modify the fourth element so that it points to the sixth element
  ```

  E. Confirm that a particular element -- say x -- is present in the array?  In the list?

  ``` 
  Array: between 1 and n units 
    Once the element is found, you can stop traversing the array
  List: between 1 and n units
    Once the element is found, you can stop traversing the list
  ```

  F. Confirm that a particular element -- say y -- is NOT present in the array?  In the list?
  ``` 
  Array: n units
    You cannot stop traversing the array until you have checked every element for y
  List: n units
    You cannot stop traversing the list until you have checked every element for y
  ```

Now assume that you can maintain one extra piece of storage for the data structure.  In the case of the array, you may want to maintain a length reference.
In the case of the linked list, what would be similarly helpful?
 ``` 
In the case of the linked list, it would be helpful to have a pointer to the last element.
```

G. How much would it cost now to add an element to the end of the array?  To add an element to the end of the list?
``` 
Array: 1 unit 
List: 1 unit
```

H. How much would it cost now to delete an element from the array?  From the list?  What if it were the final element?  The penultimate element?
``` 
Array: 
  Any element: 1 + 2(n-(index+1)) units
    Delete element, access each of the later elements and write their values to the preceding indices
  Final element: 1 unit
    Delete element using the length reference to access array[length-1]
  Penultimate element: 3 units
    Delete element at array[length-2], access last element, write its value to array[length-2]
List: 
  Any element: index + 1 units
    Traverse list until the element at array[index], modify it to point to array[index+1]
  Final element: 2 units
    Traverse list from the last element to the penultimate element and remove its pointer
  Penultimate element: 3 units
    Traverse list from the last element to the third to last element and modify it to point to the last element
```

Finally, assume that both the array and the linked list are sorted, i.e., that their elements are in some predictable order (say, comparable by < or <=).

J. How much would it cost to confirm that a particular element -- say x -- is present in the array?  In the list?  To confirm that a particular element -- say y -- is not present in the array?  In the list?
``` 
Array: 
List: 
```
