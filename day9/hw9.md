## 1. Reading

Read Sipser pp. 101–125. (This was the optional reading for today. It is required for Monday.)

## 2. Constructing Grammars

Construct a Context Free Grammar for each of the following languages.

a) All strings (over {0,1}) consisting of a substring _w_ followed by its reverse. (This is the same problem you were asked to work on in class.)

R: S -> 0S0 | 1S1 | epsilon
S: S
Sigma: {0,1}
V: {S}

Give a derivation for `010010`.

S -> 0S0 -> 01S10 -> 010S010 -> 010010

b) All strings (over {a,b,c}) of the form a^{i}b^{i}c^{j}: an equal number of `a`s and `b`s, followed by any number of `c`s. For example, `aabb`, `aabbcc`, and `aabbcccc`, but not `aaaabbcc`.

R: S -> TU
   T -> aTb | epsilon
   U -> cU | epsilon
S: S
Sigma: {a,b,c}
V: {S,T,U}

c) All strings (over {a,b,c}) of the form a^{i}b^{j}c^{j}: any number of `a`s, followed by an equal number of `b`s and `c`s. For example, `abbcc`, `aabbcc`, and `aaaabbcc`, but not `aabbccc`.

R: S -> TU
   T -> aT | epsilon
   U -> bUc | epsilon
S: S
Sigma: {a,b,c}
V: {S,T,U}

d) Give two distinct grammars that produce the strings described by the regular expression `(ab)*`: empty, `ab`, `abab`, `ababab`, ….

R: S -> abS | epsilon
S: S
V: {S}
Sigma: {a,b}

R: S -> Sab | epsilon
S: S
V: {S}
Sigma: {a,b}

## 4. Ambiguous Grammars

Consider the grammar:

    S --> a S | a S b S | epsilon 

This grammar is ambiguous. Show in particular that the string `a a b` has
two:

a. parse trees

   S
  / \
 a   S
  / | | \ 
 a  S b  S
    |    |
epsilon epsilon 

    S
 / | | \
a  S b  S
  / \    \
 a   S   epsilon
      \
      epsilon

b. leftmost derivations (These are the ones that, starting from the start variable, rewrite the leftmost nonterminal first.)

S -> aS -> aaSbS -> aabS -> aab
S -> aSbS -> aaSbS -> aabS -> aab

c. rightmost derivations (These are the ones that, starting from the start variable, rewrite the rightmost nonterminal first.)

S -> aS -> aaSbS -> aaSb -> aab
S -> aSbS -> aSb -> aaSb -> aab

Extra Credit/Challenge: Prove that this grammar generates all and only the strings of `a`s and `b`s such that every prefix has at least as many `a`s as `b`s. **Hint: Do the readings!**

## 5. [Optional] Play with Prolog

Read the page and download the sample files from [here](https://sites.google.com/site/focs16fall/prolog).

Warning: your instructor was unable to get these to reliably run today, and some of the instructions are from memory of when it previously worked. Your mileage may vary.
